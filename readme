                           smoothing-language-models

build and smooth language models using the 'good-turing' and 'kneser-ney'
smoothing methods, as well as calculating the perplexity of a language model.

note:

put example files in each language for generating the models in a directory
named 'languages/'.  the names of the language files in the 'languages/'
directory define the language names.

the models for each language will be stored in a directory named 'models/'.
